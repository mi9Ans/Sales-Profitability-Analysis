# 📊 Sales & Profitability Analysis  
## Margin Leakage & Discount Governance

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project delivers an end-to-end profitability deep dive using a **$2.2M+ sales transaction dataset** to evaluate pricing effectiveness and uncover the *true order-level profit performance*.  

Rather than focusing only on revenue, the analysis identifies **where and why margin erosion occurs**, enabling data-backed pricing control and margin protection.

## 🚀 Key Insights & Business Impact  

### 🔻 Margin Leakage Detection  
Approximately **20% of total orders** were generating a **negative contribution margin**, directly reducing overall profitability.

### 🎯 Root Cause Analysis  
The primary cause of loss-making transactions was traced to **aggressive discounting patterns** across specific product categories and customer segments.

### ⚠️ Risk Mitigation  
A **Power BI dashboard** was developed to provide clear visibility into:
- High-risk orders  
- Discount impact on margins  
- Profitability trends over time  

### 🏛️ Strategic Governance  
The analysis framework was structured into monitoring metrics to support **pricing governance** and improve **discount control decisions**.
