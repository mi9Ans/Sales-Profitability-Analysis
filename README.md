# Sales & Profitability Diagnostic

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and profitability performance to identify margin leakage, assess the impact of discounting, and isolate structurally loss-making segments.

The focus is not on descriptive dashboards, but on diagnostic, decision-oriented analysis—answering *why* profits underperform despite strong sales and *where* management should intervene first.

The project concludes with an executive-style brief summarizing key KPIs, insights, and recommended actions.

## Business Questions Addressed
- How profitable is the business at an overall and order level?
- What percentage of orders are structurally loss-making?
- Do higher discounts actually improve profitability?
- Which regions, categories, and sub-categories drive profit vs losses?
- Are losses driven by demand issues or margin inefficiencies?
- What actions would most effectively improve margins?

---

## Key KPIs
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Overall Profit Margin
- Loss-Making Orders (% of total orders)
- Average Discount
- Profit Margin by Discount Level
- Profit Contribution by Region and Category

---

## Key Insights
- ~20% of orders are loss-making, indicating structural margin leakage rather than isolated issues.
- High-discount orders contribute a meaningful share of revenue but generate net losses, making aggressive discounting unprofitable.
- Certain regions generate strong sales volumes while consistently underperforming on margins.
- Losses are concentrated in specific sub-categories, suggesting pricing and cost-structure issues rather than weak demand.

## Analysis Approach
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Python (Pandas)
- Order-level profitability analysis
- Discount segmentation to evaluate revenue vs margin trade-offs
- Regional and category-level margin diagnostics
- KPI calculation and validation
- Executive-level synthesis of insights and recommendations

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (Dashboard & KPI visualization)
- GitHub (Version control & documentation)

---

## Deliverables
- Power BI dashboard for KPI tracking and segmentation
- Python notebook with full analysis and calculations
- Executive Brief (PDF) summarizing findings and recommendations

---

## Key Recommendations
- Introduce discount caps for structurally loss-making products
- Reprice or rationalize consistently negative-margin sub-categories
- Conduct region-specific pricing reviews to reflect cost differences
- Track profit per order as a primary KPI, not revenue alone
