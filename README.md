Sales & Profitability Analysis: Margin Leakage & Discount Governance
📌 Project Overview
This project involved a deep-dive analysis of a $2.2M+ sales transaction dataset to evaluate pricing effectiveness and overall profit performance. The goal was to move beyond high-level sales figures to understand the "true" profitability at an order level and identify where the business was losing money.

🚀 Key Insights & Business Impact

Margin Leakage Detection: Identified that ~20% of total orders were generating a negative contribution margin.


Root Cause Analysis: Pinpointed specific discounting patterns as the primary driver for profit-negative transactions.


Risk Mitigation: Developed a Power BI dashboard to provide real-time visibility into high-risk orders and discount impact.


Strategic Governance: Structured the analysis into performance monitoring metrics to support executive-level pricing control.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. Data Processing (SQL)
Utilized CTEs and Window Functions to calculate order-level profitability and rank customer segments.

3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
Engineered KPIs to monitor margin risk and track profit trends over time.

Created visual reports to show the correlation between high discount rates and negative margin outcomes.

📂 Repository Structure
